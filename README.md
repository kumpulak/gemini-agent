# Gemini Agent

Agent wrapper for Gemini using the v1alpha Live API.

## Installation

### Regular Installation

Install the package:

    pip install -e .

### Development Installation

Install with development dependencies:

    pip install -e ".[dev]"

## Usage

Run the example script:

    python example.py

## Features

- Function calling with automatic parsing of Python function signatures and docstrings.
- Support for built-in Google Search and Code Execution tools.

## Authentication

Set your Gemini API key in the `.env` file:

    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

## How It Works

The `Agent` wrapper uses the Google Generative AI Python SDK, specifically leveraging the `v1alpha` Live API (`google.genai.live`) for asynchronous interaction and tool handling:

1. Each task execution (`agent.run()`) initiates a connection using the Live API.
2. The agent parses your Python function signatures and docstrings to create tool declarations compatible with the Gemini API.
3. These declarations, along with requests to enable built-in tools (Code Execution, Google Search), are sent to the model.
4. When the model decides to use a tool, it sends a `ToolCall` back.
5. The `Agent` executes the corresponding Python function (or handles built-in tool calls) and sends the results back to the model using a `ToolResponse`.
6. The model incorporates the tool results and generates the final text response.

## Main Example Script

See the `example.py` file for a runnable example demonstrating various features of the `Agent` wrapper, including multiple tool calls and built-in tool usage. 

## Example Outputs

Below are example outputs from running the agent with different tasks, including the tool calls that were made during execution.

### Demo 1: Calendar Management and Weather

**Task:** 
> Could you help me with two things? First, I need to clear my schedule for today - please check my calendar for today's appointments and cancel all of them. After that, let me know what the current weather is like in New York City. Thanks!

**Response:**
> Tool: `query_calendar(date='today')`
>
> OK. It looks like you have three appointments today: "Weekly Team Meeting" at 09:00-10:30 (ID: 101), "Lunch with Client" at 13:00-14:00 (ID: 102), and "Project Review" at 16:00-17:00 (ID: 103). I will now cancel all of these.
>                                                        
> Tool: `cancel_appointment(appointment_id='101')`
>
> Tool: `cancel_appointment(appointment_id='102')`
>
> Tool: `cancel_appointment(appointment_id='103')`
>
> All your appointments for today have been canceled. Now, let me check the weather in New York City.
>
> Tool: `get_current_weather(location='New York City')`
>
> The current weather in New York City is partly cloudy with a temperature of 22 degrees Celsius.

### Demo 2: Travel Booking Assistance with Loyalty Programs

**Task:**
> I need your help with travel planning for a trip to New York today. First, check available flights from San Francisco to New York. Then find me some hotels in New York with at least 4-star ratings. Also check my loyalty program accounts to see what points I have available. Based on all this information, recommend the best flight and hotel options considering both price and my loyalty points.

**Response:**
> Tool: `get_flight_options(date='today', origin='San Francisco', destination='New York')`
>
> Tool: `query_sqlite_hotels(city='New York', rating_min='4')`
>
> Tool: `query_loyalty_programs(destination='New York')`
>
> Okay, here's a breakdown of your travel options and recommendations:
>
> **Flights:**
>
> * American Airlines (AA123): SFO to JFK, departs 8:00 AM, arrives 11:30 AM, $349.99.
> * Delta (DL456): SFO to LGA, departs 10:15 AM, arrives 1:45 PM, $425.50.
> * United (UA789): SFO to EWR, departs 1:45 PM, arrives 5:15 PM, $315.75
>
> **Hotels (4-star and above):**
>
> * The Grand Plaza (JW Marriott): 4.7 rating, Midtown, $450/night or 50,000 Marriott Bonvoy points.
> * City Lights Hotel (DoubleTree): 4.2 rating, Times Square, $275/night or 70,000 Hilton Honors points.

>   * Luxury weekend package at Waldorf Astoria with Hilton for 95,000 points (valued at $750)
>
> **Recommendations:**
>
> 1. **Flights:** The United flight (UA789) is the most affordable at $315.75 and gets you to New York in the afternoon. However, if you want an early start to your day in New York the American Airlines flight may be a better option for a slightly higher price of $349.99. Also, you have some Delta SkyMiles available, but it doesn't look like you have enough to redeem for a flight today.
> 2. **Hotels:** Given your points balances, using Marriott Bonvoy or Hilton Honors is the best value. The JW Marriott is a high-end option that you can use points for. Alternatively, the Hilton Midtown or DoubleTree are good options with strong ratings and less points. You can use your Hilton points for Hilton Midtown for 80,000 points. Considering value and your points, use 50,000 Marriott points for The Grand Plaza is a great way to maximize your points for a luxury stay. This could also be paired with the 25% discount off Broadway shows with Marriott Platinum status.
>
> **Summary:**
>
> For the best value, consider the United flight to EWR, for $315.75, paired with the JW Marriott The Grand Plaza, using 50,000 Marriott Bonvoy points.
